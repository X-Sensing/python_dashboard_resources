# python_dashboard_resources

This repo is a place to store some info, notebooks and code samples for the X-sensing workshop Python Plotly dashboard building demo. 

### Purpose

The goal here is not aesthetic visualizations or profesional level web-apps but to serve as an example of an all in one solution for serving simple interactive dashboards at level that would be useful for scientic teams or internal analytics and data sharing. 

In this context there are some advantages:

<ul>
<li> The entire app can be created in a single python program which handles the construction of webpage, the interactive visualizations and the widget and components to control them.
<li> It only uses free open-source resources. Python, Plotly Charts, Plotly Dash, Flask and deployed on a linux machine.
<li> Once some personal styles are chosen and the basic ideas understood, there are sufficient examples and libraries available that it is reasonable to take a personal "grey box approach" and requires only small amount of web-languages such as HTML and CSS.
<li> It is native to the more powerful data-science, data-manipulation. statistical and mathematical modeling languages. i.e. python (and an R version). And so seemless integrates with modeling and analytics projects.
<li>
</ul>



A running version of the simple dashboard demo we are making can be found here (not currently finished):
